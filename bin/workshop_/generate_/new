# params: [COMMAND]
# desc: create a new command called COMMAND, and sets up help and basic folder structure
# It creates a new command with same help functionality as the current command and copies the generate commands across

#
# And all generate subcommands:
#
# runner generate command test
# runner generate new runner1
